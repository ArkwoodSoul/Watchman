# Watchman
An open-source arrival, departure, and CTE tracker for NationStates.
It works by reading the API shards for moves and endings, and filters by region. It sorts this information, and posts it in a designated discord channel via webhook.

The config file contains fields for all the necessary information. Should you wish to alter the code, do so as you see fit.
